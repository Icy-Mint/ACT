# Capacitor Carbon Emissions Model
# =============================================================================

# Energy-based model 
# based on https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/130419/1/LCA%20and%20EnvProfile%20Evaluations%20of%20Capacitors%20Manuscript%20-%20CLEAN.pdf
# assumes emissions cost to manufacture 1 kg of 1 uF capacitors
# the numbers here represent one carbon intensity profile
# we expect that the manufacturing for passives does not change dramatically over time
# model values are provided in units of MJ equivalent per kg of manufactured components

# multilayer ceramic capacitor
mlcc: 6862 MJ / kg

# tantalum electrolytic capacitor
tec: 5567 MJ / kg

# Package-based emission factors (direct CO2e per capacitor)
# Based on Ecoinvent 3.11 cutoff database
# Dataset: capacitor production, for surface-mounting (105.4263333 kg CO2e/kg)
# Converted to per-capacitor values based on typical package weights
# =============================================================================
# Package 0201 (kg CO2e)
0201: 0.000036 kg
  
# Package 0402 (kg CO2e)
0402: 0.000146 kg
  
# Package 0603 (kg CO2e)
0603: 0.000611 kg
  
# Package 0805 (kg CO2e)
0805: 0.001067 kg

# Note: Package weights are typical values and may vary by manufacturer
